abstract = {A substantial amount of research has been carried out in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models, especially in those which explain the deep architectures of neural networks. A number of XAI approaches have been proposed to achieve trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as well as provide explainability of specific decisions made within these models. Among these approaches, global interpretation methods have emerged as the prominent methods of explainability because they have the strength to explain every feature and the structure of the model. This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive review of global interpretation methods that completely explain the behaviour of the AI models. We present a taxonomy of the available global interpretations models and systematically highlight the critical features and algorithms that differentiate them from local as well as hybrid models of explainability. Through examples and case studies from the literature, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the global interpretation models and assess challenges when these methods are put into practice. We conclude the paper by providing the future directions of research in how the existing challenges in global interpretation methods could be addressed and what values and opportunities could be realized by the resolution of these challenges.}
